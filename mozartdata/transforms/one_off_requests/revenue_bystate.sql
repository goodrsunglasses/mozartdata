/*
caveats to the code below:
I was able to grab shipping state with the caveat that it was the shipping state associated with the record which had the GL activity. confusing wording.

But let's say the Cash Sale has revenue GL impact, and the shipping state is CA. But the IF (which doesn't have revenue impact) has a shipping state of PA. 
I would report CA. I haven't done an audit, but I would nope 99% of the time these are the same state. I've seen cases where the address is slightly different Street instead of St for example.

With more time, I could grab the IF date (especially with some of the parent transaction work Kaden and I have been doing) if that's necessary.

What I could NOT get is the location we shipped from. I can pull location from the order, but its' not perfect, since orders can be sourced from multiple DCs, 
and we don't have a good way (today) to break down where each item was sourced from, and then associate that to it's portion of the GL impact. (oof :cold_sweat: thinking about it)

Also note: you have to run this in snowflake in order to export. It is too many rows for mozart or sheet sync.
