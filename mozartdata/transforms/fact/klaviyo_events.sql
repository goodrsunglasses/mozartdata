/*
Purpose: This table contains data about klaviyo events. This data comes from an API connection
set up through the vendor Portable which directly feeds the data into our Snowflake db. This table contains a LOT of
rows(Multi-millions). So the source data from portable is only for the past 90 days. So we have a staging table
(staging.klaviyo_events) which incrementally loads data daily. Then this fact is built off of the entire set of events.
Transforms: all dates are natively in UTC, so I converted them to LA time.
About this data: This data is one row per event. Events are another word for metrics. So you can look at
dim.klaviyo_metrics for a list of possible events. Though we included the metric names with the IDs for ease of analysis.
event_properties is a big json blob where we extract key information about the event (campaign, flow, client info, etc.).
There are potentially more data points in the blob worth extracting, but waiting on SDAs to weigh in.
